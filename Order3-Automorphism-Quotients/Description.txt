Here we take quotients of various Calabi-Yau threefolds in Meyer's book by automorphism groups of order 3. We then try to determine the modularity of these quotients. Twork in progress.

There is one example in this folder - it can be modified to include all example. See the folder Elliptic-Surfaces for an example.
