# Modularity-and-Calabi-Yau-Threefolds
In a book by Christian Meyer titled "Modularity of Calabi-Yau Threefolds", the author counted points on various Calabi-Yau threefolds over finite fields, and compared these point counts to coefficients appearing in the L-series of certain newforms with the goal of finding numerical evidence for the modularity of the threefolds in question. In the current project, we study quotients of many "non-rigid" Calabi-Yau threefolds in Meyer's book by various automorphism groups, with hopes that the quotient is modular and "rigid" (this technique originally appeared in a paper by Dominik Burek). It is an open problem whether every the L-series of every weight 4 newform equals the L-series of a rigid Calabi-Yau threefold. This project was co-supervised by Colin Ingalls and Adam Logan and supported by an Undergraduate Student Research Award from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council.
